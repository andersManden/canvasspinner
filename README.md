# Canvasspinner

Canvasspinner is a small library of, easy to use, spinners, which is made with javascript and the HTML5 canvas element. 

# How to spin
All you need to do is to include the provided files into the head.

<i>You only need a container div, with a canvas element embedded. </i><br>


<i>Then you need to put these id's into an object. </i> <br>
var <b>spinnerObj</b> = { <br>
    type : "clockSpinner", <br>
    containerId : "containerId",<br>
    canvasId : "canvasId"<br>
};<br>

<i>Then call the canvasspinner, and your done.</i><br>
canvasspinner.init(<b>spinnerObj</b>);

Every spinner is ofcourse customizable, and each example is demonstrated in the index.html file.</b></b>

# Disclaimer
The canvasspinner project is at a very early stage, so be aware that some spinners not yet are fully customizable yet. And others might be glitchy etc...</b></b>

# Credits

This library has been build upon the utils and particle library created by Keith Peters in the coding math video series.
